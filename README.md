# Cube of pointlessness

This is my personal project completed in week 6 of the Enspiral Dev Academy boot camp. I have made some small changes since then to tidy up the code for presentation.

## What is it all about
This project shows floating cubes. Users can select which cube to see, rate the cube and add some special effects.

I used this project as a sandpit so that I could try out and expore react.js, P5.js and knex.js.

## Deployed to Heroku
This project has been deployed to heroku at https://cube-pointless.herokuapp.com. The effects for the random cube don't yet work.
