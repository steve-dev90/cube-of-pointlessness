# Cube of pointlessness

This is my personnel project completed in week 6 of the Enspiral Dev Academy boot camp. I have made some small changes since then to tidy up the code for presentation.

This project was really just a (pointless) sandpit so that I could try out React.js and P5.js. 

It has been deployed to heroku at https://cube-pointless.herokuapp.com/#/cubes/662.
