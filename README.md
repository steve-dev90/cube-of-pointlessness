# Cube of pointlessness

This is my personnel project completed in week 6 of the Enspiral Dev Academy boot camp. I have made some small changes since then to tidy up the code for presentation.

## What is it all about
This project was really just a (pointless) sandpit so that I could try out React.js and explore using P5.js. There is also a small database which allows users to rate cubes, again this feature was so that I could try out using RESTFUL api routes.

## Deployed
This project has been deployed to heroku at https://cube-pointless.herokuapp.com/#/cubes/662. The effects for the random cube don't work yet
